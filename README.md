This GitHub repository contains data on dengue fever cases and climatological data in San Juan and Iquitos from 1990 to 2010, which can be found in the "data" folder.

Furthermore, it includes aggregated country-level data for Puerto Rico (for San Juan) and Peru (for Iquitos) on the case fatality rate of the infectious disease, the number of deaths, severe dengue cases, disease serotypes, existing population, and incidence rate, which can be found in the "other" folder.

Finally, with the aim of predicting the spread of dengue fever, two approaches have been developed to prevent the number of infected cases. On one hand, there is a classification analysis that attempts to predict the high infection rate by considering the number of infected cases above the average.
On the other hand, there is a regression analysis that aims to continuously predict the total number of dengue cases. These analyses can be found in the "src" folder.
